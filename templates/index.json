Numerous published research articles have established the health benefits of these unique and powerful mushrooms. Support for immune health is the primary benefit. Functional mushrooms contain beta glucans which are important for immune system functionality. Humans do not produce beta glucans and, therefore, functional mushrooms can play an important role in supporting daily health and wellness. In addition to immune health, each type, or species of mushroom provides its own special benefits including aiding cognitive and neurological health, gut health, cardiovascular health, bone health, healthy blood sugar, liver health, beauty (healthy hair, skin and nails), vitality, sports performance and recovery, and support for the management of occasional stress, both physical and mental."

            "answer": "Om Mushrooms provide a variety of nutritional benefits. Some of the primary ingredients include beta glucans and other polysaccharides, polyphenols, prebiotic non-soluble fiber, and digestive enzymes that support immune function. Functional mushrooms also contain vitamins, such as Vitamin D, minerals, and amino acids/proteins. In addition, there are many mushroom-specific compounds such as triterpenes (from Reishi and Turkey Tail), cordycepin (from cordyceps) and neurotrophic factors (from Lion’s Mane) all of which contribute to overall health and wellness."

Mycelial biomass is the root-like structure of the mushroom, the most bioactive stage of the mushroom life cycle. The mycelium is the primary life system of the mushroom and is full of polysaccharides, prebiotic fibers, neurotrophic and immune-supporting compounds."
