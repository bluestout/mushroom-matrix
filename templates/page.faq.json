Our products contain all the life stages of the mushroom including myceliated biomass, primordia (baby mushrooms), and, in most species, fruit bodies that are grown and processed at our indoor, environmentally-controlled facility at our Vista, CA facility. </p><p>At the completion of the growing process, the mature mushroom material is chopped and steam-cooked.  The steam-cooking improves the digestibility of the mushrooms and the bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. We then carefully dehydrate our mushrooms at moderate temperatures and mill into a fine powder. </p><p>The result is a full spectrum, gluten-free, non-GMO product with naturally-occurring antioxidants, immunomodulating beta glucans, and other bioactive compounds and vital nutrients. We are Certified 100% Organic and a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliant facility to ensure highest quality and efficacy.

            "question": "Are your products extracted? Do you have any products that have standardized beta glucans?",
            "answer": "<p>Beta glucan standardization can generally only be done with extracted products-- you keep extracting and concentrating until you reach the desired concentration with hot-extraction processes followed by spray-drying or the use of solvents to precipitate the beta glucans out of solution.  Often with \"standardized\" beta glucan mushroom products, the standardization of beta glucan content is achieved by spiking the mushrooms with cheaper- and easier-to-produce yeast-derived beta glucans that cannot be differentiated analytically from the mushroom-derived beta glucans.</p><p>Using sample preparation steps that are appropriate for our unextracted, whole food mushroom powders, we get beta glucan contents in our mushroom powders that are greater than 20% (DW). Although there is a diversity of opinions, it is generally thought that somewhere between 250 and 500 mg/day of beta glucans is sufficient to trigger the host-mediated immune responses to beta glucans that result in the support and balancing of immune function.  At a 20% beta glucan content, our recommended daily serving does provide sufficient beta glucans to trigger a cascade of host-mediated immune responses and cell-signaling events.  More is not always better.</p><p>It is important to note that while beta glucans do get the most attention regarding the immune support provided by mushrooms, beta glucans are by no means the only constituents that are present in unextracted, functional mushroom powders that work together to support immune function.  Other immunity-supporting constituents include fungal alpha glucans, prebiotic dietary fibers, antioxidants (glutathione, ergothioneine, polyphenols, SOD), triterpenes, sterols, peptides, vitamins and minerals.</p>"

If you have multiple horses or horses in competition that may use more than one scoop daily, you may want to consider the foundation Equine Mushroom Matrix products as they are available larger sizes.  Horses under veterinary care or performing at top levels often need the additional support of twice day dosing.
