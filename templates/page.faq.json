            "question": "Are your products extracted? Do you have any products that have standardized beta glucans?",
            "answer": "<p>Beta glucan standardization can generally only be done with extracted products-- you keep extracting and concentrating until you reach the desired concentration with hot-extraction processes followed by spray-drying or the use of solvents to precipitate the beta glucans out of solution.  Often with \"standardized\" beta glucan mushroom products, the standardization of beta glucan content is achieved by spiking the mushrooms with cheaper- and easier-to-produce yeast-derived beta glucans that cannot be differentiated analytically from the mushroom-derived beta glucans.</p><p>Using sample preparation steps that are appropriate for our unextracted, whole food mushroom powders, we get beta glucan contents in our mushroom powders that are greater than 20% (DW). Although there is a diversity of opinions, it is generally thought that somewhere between 250 and 500 mg/day of beta glucans is sufficient to trigger the host-mediated immune responses to beta glucans that result in the support and balancing of immune function.  At a 20% beta glucan content, our recommended daily serving does provide sufficient beta glucans to trigger a cascade of host-mediated immune responses and cell-signaling events.  More is not always better.</p><p>It is important to note that while beta glucans do get the most attention regarding the immune support provided by mushrooms, beta glucans are by no means the only constituents that are present in unextracted, functional mushroom powders that work together to support immune function.  Other immunity-supporting constituents include fungal alpha glucans, prebiotic dietary fibers, antioxidants (glutathione, ergothioneine, polyphenols, SOD), triterpenes, sterols, peptides, vitamins and minerals.</p>"

If you have multiple horses or horses in competition that may use more than one scoop daily, you may want to consider the foundation Equine Mushroom Matrix products as they are available larger sizes.

            "answer": "<p>You can mix it with water and administer with an oral syringe. If you are mixing it into dry food, moisten with broth, bone broth or water and mix before feeding. If you are feeding wet or raw food, most dogs will eat it readily if it is mixed well into the food. If you are giving a loading (double) dose split the dose into morning and evening feedings when possible. You can also cut the dose in half and build up to a full dose if necessary. Pets are like people and sometimes have individual food likes and dislikes.  Some dogs that are ill will lose their appetite as well.  In these cases, try mixing it with peanut butter, cottage cheese or some other favored, soft food.  Cats and some dogs frequently enjoy it mixed with crushed sardines packed in oil. </p>"

Your decision should depend on several factors, including how the product has been stored and whether or not the product is discolored, rancid, or noticeably changed. For example, if the product kept in a cool dry place, and looks and smells normal this may allow for consumption after the Best Used By date. If any signs of degradation are evident it’s best to discard the product.</p>"
